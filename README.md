## Storybook for React Apps

This is MealDrop, the real-world app used in the [Storybook for React apps](https://www.newline.co/courses/storybook-for-react-apps) course built by [Yann Braga](https://twitter.com/yannbf) to serve as an example for all the cool things you can do with Storybook!

It's a food delivery app built from scratch with:

- Modern React with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and hooks
- Styles with [Styled components](http://styled-components.com/)
- State management [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) with [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- Tests with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- Routing with [React router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- Component explorer [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn storybook`

Launches Storybook on port 6006.

## Each module has its own branch

Ideally you can just work on top of the main branch of this course. However, if you want to jump into a specific module of the course, each module contains its own branches, both for the beginning of the module and for the end of the module following this pattern: `module-0X-begin` and `module-0X-end`.

For instance, for module 03, you can find the branches `module-03-begin` and `module-03-end`.

## Accessing the final version of this project

The final code for this course can be found in the `module-06-end` branch.
The end result is a limited version of the original MealDrop project, which contains every component in Storybook and more addons etc. and can be found [here](https://github.com/yannbf/mealdrop).
